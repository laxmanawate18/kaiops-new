# The `app` package is imported as the uvicorn target (`app.fast_api_app`), so
# Python only has the project root (/code) on sys.path — NOT /code/app. The
# specialist agents live at `app/agents/*`, so we must add this package dir to
# sys.path BEFORE importing anything that does `import agents.*`.
